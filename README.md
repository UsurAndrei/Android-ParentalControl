# Android-ParentalControl (WIP)
+ Project for my Mobile App Development class

## Description 
+ This project is composed of two applications, one for the parent and one for the child. It logs the phone calls, SMS messages and location of the child.

## What I've learned so far:
+ Working on the UI of an android application.
+ Using Intents.
+ How to request permissions from an user when launching an application.
+ Using Google Firebase realtime database to write and retrieve JSON data.
+ Creating a basic background service.
+ Using Broadcast Receivers (Phone & SMS related broadcasts).
+ Using Content Observers (To observe changes in content://sms, to log outgoing SMS messages).
+ Using Location Services (Logging the location of the child).
+ Using RecyclerView, CardView, along with FirebaseRecyclerAdapter to display JSON data from a Firebase realtime database in a rich format.
+ First time working with Maps SDK (Marking the location of the child).
